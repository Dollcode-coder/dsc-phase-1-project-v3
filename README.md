## Key stakeholders Ultimate High Company
##  Business Understanding
 
 ### Objective
The goal of this project is to predict which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company since the company wants to expand into new industries to diversify its portfolio. They are interested in purchasing operational and private airplanes for commercial and private enterprises but have no idea of the risk of aircraft.

### Key Questions
1.Which manufacturers (based on 'Make') have the most accidents?
2.What type of engine on the aircraft determined the most and least fatal injuries while in the risk

### Success criteria
1. Actionable Insights -The prediction should lead to actionable insights that the company can use when purchasing an aircraft

2. Accuracy- The model has high accuracy in prediction 
 
### Constraints
1. Data Quality -The accuracy depends on the completeness of the data

## The Data Understanding

The `data` folder I am working with is from **Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses). The dataset has been used data set has been used by other data scientists before and is accessible for anyone to look through it, it is updated often. The data  is in **csv** format inside a folder named data. I then read through the data using the panda's library in order to get a data frame as our output . While understanding the output we realize the data frame has 90348 rows and 31 columns . The columns define our data by giving the different fields their names while the rows hold the information of different columns about potential risks of air flight.
